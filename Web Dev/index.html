        <h2>The way you always have felt....</h2>
        <div class="article1" id="articlediv1">
        
        <p>It's always that I write on special occasions. I have written so many things about how it feels when you are the only one who get single and left all alone. This one too is sorta same. So don't get bored while reading. Try to finish. Maybe you will understand a guy's perspective and how he feels for someone. <br>



            Today was freshers day. The so called day to welcome all the students who have joined engineering. Let me describe you my today's routine. As usual, I got up in morning, in a blip I finished my morning routine till breakfast. Jumped to college. We were made to sit in the auditorium and generally made to listen to boring speeches of those suit n coat chief guest. And then cultural events and then back home and then here. In front of you. <br>
          
           What did you see here? A normal day? Not exactly. I saw people, not in their usual behaviour! I saw people with changed perspective! Maybe towards camera more! I guess, that's the thing. They try to be the part of the cover page and move to next cover page! <br>
          
          I guess that's what happened to me. I was left behind, because I couldn't be in the trend! I couldn't be what it takes to be in front of cameras. I was being me as usual! It's sad to get downsized! And especially by your friends! But then the usual program went well! We ate and danced till death. It was fun, it would have been more if someone looked back! Looked back to see if they are covering everyone in the pic!  Who ever is reading this, you may be the one who stood in front and held your face upright in every scene and picture taken! <br>
          
          
          
          Well I'm not that person. I want to be, the right way but I'm just telling what it feels to be in behind the scenes of surrounding! Well the hot day ended, where I gulped a cup of icecream till I no more felt my brain! That's how I liberate my hard feelings. I ended the day with Watching Doctor Strange! </p>

        <h2>Uhh Look........ </h2>
        <div class="article1" id="articlediv2">
        
        <p>You know I did what I did. I probably wouldn't understood you in every way. Well after times goes, it left me behind a note. That I'm not different. I'm same like you, I just haven't been thinking straight. And of all the closest people you are the most. It's not easy to let go of you. I guess you too feel the same sometime. <br>

            I could get my head straight, because there is something I do. I imagine looking at shattered particles and wonder why they just cannot get back to their place. I know that you know how I feel, every inch. It's sometimes about me, wanting you to be there. I can't always be a sad prick always. I feel I can be happy with you. It's always about courage, because deep down there is something that we are scared. Scared of something unusual. As a human we think of possibilities. You taught me that probabilities and possibilities are two different things.<br>
            
            But then growing up is always sad, and we know death is inevitable. So part of life is acceptance and part of life is falling in love. It's all about timing and the right person to fall for! </p>

        <h2>Incandescent Bulb</h2>
        <div class="article1" id="articlediv3">
        
        <p>Well for now nobody reads this blog. So I can write any stupid stuff here. get ready, Down here is something where you would wonder, why this guy is so glitchy!!( Honestly there is no word as glitchy, I made that up).<br>

            Today a friend of mine called me "ARROGANT!", "SELF-Centered", "Ridiculous". I felt so good. Let me give a break, and walk you through what happened in past. Point is I may be an ass while talking to people, or at least they think I am. Reason: I tell facts. I am not funny in words. I may say that you are stupid, or get mad if i don't good response back. I scold them and make a fuss of that situation. Intention wise, all i want is for someone to care about me, talk to me thoroughly. Everybody feel something, either it's  feeling of attraction, or a disliking someone thoroughly. Feeling happy, sad, low etc. I don't know what she has gone through, how had time treated her. <br>
            
            Today I saw a post, that said " Because not a lot of people will ask you this. Or they might, but not mean it. Although it needs to be asked sometimes. So today I ask ; How are you?" after looking at this, my system was refined. Thoughts filtered. 
            
            We both had issues back then, and she didn't wanted to talk about it. I had "breakdown" of my assembly line of my thought process. And we had a thing, it was called "Not talking". It was actually her thing. She quoted " I don't ignore people, I just make them feel ignored".  I was upset over that.  Made a mess of what it was. And then today I was called those words what you can see in the beginning.If She knew me, she would tell me that I'm totally the opposite. For which one must spend an with me. It's sick to point how a person really is, by just knowing him over some text messages. It's bad to consider higher talks as over powering on someone.<br>
            
            What is going on, it is something one can understand only if that person came across me. One would know me over social media. I want people to know me, not misunderstand me over my arrogant talks or bad jokes. For every misunderstanding with me, there is regret ahead.

        <h2>Blind Date</h2>
        <div class="article1" id="articlediv4">
        
        <p> I stood still in my backyard and counted the number of leaves of lemon plant. Sounds not okay, right!?.<br>

            Let me tell you, by taking you back when blank spaces had no value. I used to text her even knowing it ain't worth to. This sentence may seem offending. But it is fun. She is predictable. There were coincidences while typing and laughing sometimes due to my sick talks.<br>
            
             I like the way she looks out if windows. Have been observing for more than a year. It's pretty much hard to reach the inner self. She keeps herself thinking and wandering about reality and stuff she doesn't want to disclose.<br>
            
             Well, to say some people are like those who meet in bus stops. They would be till the time when their station arrives. The same way i met this insanely built mind. Which goes crazy sometimes, and numb other. I have seen variables. But not the whole equation in one. I don't exactly know why I want to talk to her. Whenever I think about this it just feels like "Karna kya chata hai be tu?‚Äù. I don't know if I'm scared, worried or anything else. 
            Because maybe I think it's part of our lives where we take different "BUSES" and spread out.<br>
            
            I hear echoes of those laughs and small talks between us very often. But why counting lemon leaves? It's pretty simple. I actually don't know what I am doing. It just feels heavy. It feels blank from outside. Maybe it's just my brain fooling itself, like a hypnosis. <br>
            
            I want to say that she obviously is a piece of unique art, like those kept in museum. Has a lot value but aren't hired by anyone. This is what exactly I think about her. Even though I text and get replies, I feel I missed the whole of what she exactly is. Exactly like a " FILL IN THE BLANK" ___ to which answer is unknown.  </p>
